  "welcomeText": "Hi there! My name is Yves and I'm working as a fullstack web developer since 2020. I have a Bachelor of Science ZFH in Computer Science from ZHAW School of Engineering. When it comes to frontend development, I'm a big fan of javascript frameworks like Next.js React and Vue. When it comes to backend, I prefer working with NodeJS. NestJS and Express are my favorite NodeJS frameworks for backend services at the moment. If possible, I always work with Typescript in my projects.",
